Description: This latex template design was based on the Google Material Design and uses the font Roboto from Android.

In order to replace the profile image you just need to replace the profile.png image with another image (the image used was already rounded and with transparent background).

The compilation should be made using pdflatex (for version 1.0 check the instructions from the previous Readme in tag v1.0).
In order to make it easier to edit each of the sections, all the sections were separated into individual .tex files.

This template might need some tweaks, since I'm in no way a latex expert.

Aknowledgements:

The font used was the font Roboto used in Android: [Roboto Font](http://developer.android.com/design/style/typography.html)

The icons used where from the material design set: [Material Icons](https://material.io/icons/)
And where changed using inkscape to change color and convert to pdf.

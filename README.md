# MaterialCV V2.0

This cv project is still under construction (hope to finish it soon)
In case you want to use the previous version just check the tag for the v1.0.

![Material CV preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amng/MaterialCv/master/images/preview.PNG)

Description: This latex template design was based on the Google Material Design for the new Android 5.0 L version, using the font Roboto from Android.

In order to replace the main image with a profile picture for example, just replace the pic.png file in the images folder with another with the same resolution  or ratio (2048x600/1024x300/etc...).

The compilation should be made using pdflatex.
In order to make it easier to edit each of the sections, all the sections were separated into individual .tex files.

Aknowledgements:

The font used was the font Roboto used in Android: [Roboto Font](http://developer.android.com/design/style/typography.html)

The icons used where from the material design set: [Material Icons](https://material.io/icons/)
And where changed using inkscape to change color and convert to pdf.
